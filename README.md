This is (hopefuly eventually going to be) an emulator for the avr 8 bit architecture, based on teh spacific charachteristics of the ATtiny85.
The project is currently in its infancy

for testing I reccomend using AVRA
# what needs doing:
 - tonnes of instructions need adding
 - might consider changing how error handling works. exceptions are probably a lot better than returnin based error handling
 - add a user interface
 - create the correct startup environment
 - program the EEPROM logic
 - split program into modules
